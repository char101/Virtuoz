# Virtuoz virtual desktop utility

This is a modification from the original [Virtuoz](https://github.com/RaMMicHaeL/Virtuoz) virtual desktop manager.

## TODO

* [x] Change hotkey to move window to another desktop from ``Alt+ ` `` to
  `Alt+Shift+<desktop number>`
* [x] Add hotkey to show a window on all desktops
* [x] Ignore pattern by executable path/name (case insensitive), basically
  windows of this executables will not be managed (hidden) by virtuoz when
  switching desktop.
* [x] Target active window when moving windows instead of window under mouse
  pointer.
* [x] Handle stray tooltip
* [ ] Load custom icon (Virtuoz.ico in the same folder as Virtuoz.exe)
* [ ] Option to dump window hwnd ids on startup and before switching desktop
* [ ] Draw current desktop number on the tray icon

Virtuoz was designed to be a minimal and robust program that allows to have more than one desktop on Windows. It was inspired by [Sysinternals Desktops](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc817881.aspx), but uses a different approach, which doesnâ€™t impose the limitations which Desktops is bound to.
